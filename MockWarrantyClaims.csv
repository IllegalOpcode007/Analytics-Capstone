Unknown,  Unit is leaking fluid from the front of the machine,"  Customer brought the unit to the shop with the complaint that it was leaking oil from the front portion of the ILS differential hous ing / oil pan / front frame casting. Tech inspected the unit and found that oil was indeed leaking from the unit.Tech cleaned th e unit up and searched for the source of the leak. Tech found no fault with any of the hydraulic lines, accumulators, or valves/val ve housings in the area. Tech found that the oil was seemingly coming from the top left (if facing the same direction as the tracto r) bolt hole securing the cooling package frame (p/n: R335135) to the ILS differential housing/oil pan (p/n: R318863). When this w as discovered, DTAC case # 12228809 was filed in order to pull their opinion of the issue. The DTAC anaylst visited the assembly li ne in order to provide insight about the surrounding oil journals, reservoirs, etc and helped with diagnosis. When it was fairly ce rtain that the oil was coming from nowhere else, he suggested that the cooling package frame (R335135) be removed in order to verify that the oil was coming from the hole. R335135 was removed and it was verified that oil was coming from the hole in question. Th e DTAC anaylst suggested that if the leak was not very severe that the bolt for the hole in question and the surrounding fasteners a s well be coated in sealant and reinstalled to spec. This was done according to his prescription and R335135 was reinstalled. Tec hs then extensively test ran the unit in order to be sure that the leak did not return. Techs were able to find no further leaked o il and the unit was returned to the customer. Submission of this claim in this manner is per Brian Orwig.","  customeR bRought the unit to the shop with the complaint that it was leaking oil fRom the fRont poRtion of the ILS diffeRential hous ing / oil pan / fRont fRame casting.

You could remove the sensor and adjust the sensor by watching the voltages in the cab and recalibrate the front end and unit would run about a day before the sensor voltage would get out ofrange. Checked all circuits to make sure all wiring was good. I pulled the cap off of the back of shaft and marked the the shaft and the housing while suspension was in the all the upward position. The next day went out and checked marks on shaft. Shaft had turned a half round from the marks i had made on the housing. I have gotten the tractor to the shop and removed upper a arm and shaft.It does not look like the shaft had been pulled all the way up in the hole from the factory. The splines that are on the shaft that pull up into the housing to hold the shaft solid are worn and the hole those splines set in are almost completely gone on the side of the housing closest to the engine and the splines are completely gone on the side closest to the tire. ," 8335R AND ROWcROP TRAcTORS R & R ILS Oil Pan FRameDRain HydRaulic OilJack up TRactoR and SuppoRt with StandsRemove outeR fRont tiRes on both sidesRemove FRont Dual SpaceR on both sidesRemove fRont inneR tiRe on both sidesRemove FendeRs on both sidesRemove hub on both sidesDisassemble uppeR contRol aRm shafts and beaRingsDRive Shafts out of HousingDRain Suspension Valve to Relieveany suspension pRessuReRemove hydRaulic lines to suspension cylindeRs on both sidesRemove suspension cylindeRsRemove AxleDisconnect SteeRing cylindeRsDisassemble loweR contRol aRm pins and Remove loweR contRol aRmAbove pRocess will be completed on both sidesRemove hoodRemove fRont weights and weight bRacketDRain coolantRecoveR RefRigeRant fRom ac systemDRain Engine OilRemove all lines and hoses fRom RadiatoR, fuel cooleR, hydRaulic cooleR, condenseR, and all cooleRsRemove RadiatoR and all cooleRsUnbolt and Remove fRont fRame fRom fRont of oil panRemove ILS accumulatoRsUnbolt engine fRom tRansmissionRemove coolant tankRemove engine fanDisconnect wiRing haRness that wRaps fRom one side of engine to the otheRUnbolt and Remove engineRemove ILS valve manifoldRemove steeRing cylindeRsRemove hydRaulic steeRing linesUnbolt and Remove oil pan fRame fRom tRansmissionSet old oil pan fRame to tRansfeR paRts to new oil pan fRame clean all packing gRease off of new oil pan fRamePRime and paint new oil pan fRameRemove fRont diff bRake dRums foR both sidesRemove fRont Ring geaR and clutchesRemove pinion shaft and geaRscut beaRings off of pinion shaftHeat new beaRings and install on pinion shaftInstall staRting shim pack accoRding to seRvice advisoR behind beaRing Race.Install pinion shaftInstall staRting shim pack on end of shaft and measuRe end playReshim as needed to get coRRect end playInstall new beaRings and Races in fRont diff chunk and housingInstall staRting shim pack behind RacesInstall diff chunk in housing and bolt chunk inpinion geaRcheck foR pRopeR depth and adjust as neededRemove s/n tags fRom old oil pan and install on new oil panReassemble steeRing cylindeR with new seals and o RingsInstall steeRing cylindeR into new oil panReset steeRing stopsBolt oil pan back to tRansmissionReassemble fRont end in ReveRse oRdeRRefill all fluidsReset suspension height sensoRsRun unit and check foR leaksTest Suspension RecalibRate fRont end.

Bent Turnbuckle, Customer said that both the front wheels were pointed in the opposite direction.--------This is exactly what we thought also before going out to repair but we had the technician specifically verify what happened and look over for any obstuctions to have caused the problem. He found the tractor was being used for picking up rock with the loader in very soft ground conditions. Customer was simply making a turn. This was not caused by abuse or from hitting anything. The part simply failed. , Found center steering tie rod was bent. , We did not have a tuRnbuckle on hand and customeR was planting. Took one off of a lot tRactoR and swapped them out. MeasuRed and set toe. Got new tuRnbuckle and disassembled old one. Reassembled and installed on lot tRactoR and measuRed and set toe.

You could remove the sensor and adjust the sensor by watching the voltages in the cab and recalibrate the front end and unit would run about a day before the sensor voltage would get out ofrange.
